How to do a Video Monkey release

This assumes the Video Monkey icon is VideoMonkeyDevel.icns (VideoMonkeyDevel in Info.plist file)

1. Make sure the tree is all checked in

2. Add an entry for this release to releasenotes.html

3. Change Info.plist for release
    - Change the 'Icon File' property to 'VideoMonkey'
    - Remove the 'x' from the 'Bundle version' property

4. Do a release build

5. Zip the VideoMonkey.app you just built (If from Finder, do 'Compress "VideoMonkey.app"')
    - Rename the zip file to videomonkey-x.y.zip

6. Add an entry to videomonkeycast.xml for the new release
    - Get the 'length' property from 'ls -l' of the zip file
    - Get the date from 'date'
    
7. Sign the .zip file:
    - Get the dsa_priv.pem file from the secret place
    - ruby sparkle/SparkleExtras/Signing\ Tools/sign_update.rb <application zip file> dsa_priv.pem
    - The result of the above will be the signature. Copy it to the sparkle:dsaSignature of the videomonkeycast.xml
    
8. Upload videomonkey-x.y.zip, releasenotes.html and videomonkeycast.xml to the website, using Cyberduck
    - Upload files to sftp://web@marrin.org/home/web/videomonkey.org/public_html/releases

9. Add new download link to videomonkey.org
    
10. Tag the tree as version x.y
    git tag -a vx.y -m"Version x.y release"
    git push --tags
    
11. Change Info.plist for next release development
    - Restore 'Icon File' property to 'VideoMonkeyDevel'
    - Change the 'Bundle version' property to <next release>x
