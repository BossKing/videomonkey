How to do a Video Monkey release

This assumes the Video Monkey icon is VideoMonkeyDevel.icns (VideoMonkeyDevel in Info.plist file)

1. Make sure the tree is all checked in

2. Add an entry for this release to releasenotes.html

3. Change the 'Icon File' property in Info.plist to 'VideoMonkey'

4. Do a release build

5. Zip the VideoMonkey.app you just built (If from Finder, do 'Compress "VideoMonkey.app"')
    - Rename the zip file to videomonkey-x.y.zip

6. Add an entry to videomonkeycast.xml for the new release
    - Get the 'length' property from 'ls -l' of the zip file
    - Get the date from 'date'
    
7. Sign the .zip file:
    - Get the dsa_priv.pem file from the secret place
    - ruby "sparkle/SparkleExtras/Signing\ Tools/sign_update.rb" <application zip file> dsa_priv.pem
    - The result of the above will be the signature. Copy it to the sparkle:dsaSignature of the videomonkeycast.xml
    
8. Upload videomonkey-x.y.zip, releasenotes.html and videomonkeycast.xml to the website, using the Downloads Manager
    - Set the category to hidden
    - Files will end up at http://videomonkey.org/releases/ (which is a link to http://videomonkey.org/wp-content/files)
    
9. Tag the tree as version x.y
    git tag -a vx.y -m"Version x.y release"
    
10. Restore icon to VideoMonkeyDevel
